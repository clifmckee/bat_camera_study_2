Bat camera vists - date palm  data

This R Markdown covers exploratory data analysis for bat camera visits at located at date palm trees. Date palm trees were observed at villages where date palm sap collection was reported. 

This exploratory data analysis will cover four sections; initial data examination and additional dataset formation, a summary of the trees and villages observed, where bats were found, and the bat feeding behavior that was observed. 

```{r load packages, message = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(naniar)
library(gtsummary)
```

#### Initial data observations

```{r import data}
date_palm_data <- readRDS(here("DATA","date_palm_visit_data.RDS"))
fruit_survey <- fruit_survey <- readRDS(here("DATA", "community_resident_fruit_survey.RDS"))
```

```{r Examine data structure}
# Examine data structure
str(date_palm_data) 

head(date_palm_data)
```

Dataset includes 8097 rows of information across 27 varibles

```{r add village type information}
# Combine with information on village type

# Dataframe with village type information
survey_villages_1 <- fruit_survey %>% 
                        select(correct_villid,case_control_group) #only keep village type information
survey_villages_1 <- survey_villages_1 %>% 
                        rename(Village_ID = correct_villid)
survey_villages_1 <- transform(survey_villages_1, Village_ID = as.numeric(Village_ID))
survey_villages_1 <- survey_villages_1[!duplicated(survey_villages_1), ] #drop duplicate observations
survey_villages_1 <- na.omit(survey_villages_1) #drop NA values
survey_villages_1 <- survey_villages_1 %>% 
  mutate("dup" = duplicated(survey_villages_1$Village_ID))

date_palm_vil <- transform(date_palm_data, Village_ID = as.numeric(Village_ID))
date_palm_vil <-
  left_join(date_palm_data,
            survey_villages_1 %>% dplyr::select(Village_ID, case_control_group))

```

#### Summary of observed villages and trees

*Village totals*

```{r Total number of villages}
n_distinct(date_palm_vil$Village_ID)

date_palm_vil %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(num_vil = n_distinct(Village_ID))
  # 14 case villages, 20 far control villages, 14 near control villages
```
There are 48 villages with date palm tree observations; 14 case villages, 14 near control villages, and 20 far control villages.

*Tree observations*

```{r Total number of trees}
n_distinct(date_palm_vil$Tree_number)
n_distinct(date_palm_vil$Tree_type)
#Why 4 tree types?

unique(date_palm_vil$Tree_type)
# Two rows again with NAs

date_palm_vil <- date_palm_vil %>% 
  mutate(correctTree_type = case_when(!is.na(Tree_type) ~ "Date palm", 
                             TRUE ~ "NA")) %>% 
  replace_with_na(correctTree_type, replace = list(correctTree_type = "NA"))

unique(date_palm_vil$correctTree_type)

```

There are 85 unique trees observed.

```{r trees by village}
# trees observed by village
date_palm_vil %>% 
  group_by(Village_ID) %>% 
  summarize(num_trees = n_distinct(Tree_number)) %>% 
  summary(num_trees)

# trees observed by village type
date_palm_vil %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(num_tree = n_distinct(Tree_number)) %>% 
  mutate("percent_vil" = num_tree/sum(num_tree)*100) %>% 
  rename(village_type = case_control_group)
```

The average number of trees observed per village is 1.8 (mix-max = 1-2). 25% of tree were observed at case villages (22 trees), 44% at far control villages (38 trees), and 30% at near control villages (26 trees). 

#### Where are bats found

```{r total number of bat visits}
# total bat visits
date_palm_vil %>%
      group_by(Number_of_visits) %>%
      summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(totalN = (cumsum(n)),
             percent = round((n / sum(n)), 3),
             cumpercent = round(cumsum(freq = n / sum(n)),3))
```

There were 8072 bat visits observed. However, bats may be observed multiple times if they exited and then reentered the camera frame. This would be counted as two separate visits. 

```{r}
# bat visits by village
bat_vil_tot <- date_palm_vil %>% 
  group_by(Village_ID) %>% 
  summarize(num_visits = sum(Number_of_visits)) %>% 
  mutate(yn_visit = case_when(num_visits > 0 ~ "yes", TRUE ~ "no")) %>% 
  inner_join(survey_villages_1 %>% dplyr::select(Village_ID, case_control_group))

# villages with no bat visits
bat_vil_tot %>%
      group_by(yn_visit) %>%
      summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(totalN = (cumsum(n)),
             percent = round((n / sum(n)), 3),
             cumpercent = round(cumsum(freq = n / sum(n)),3))

# visits by village type 
date_palm_vil %>%
      group_by(case_control_group) %>%
      summarise(n = sum(Number_of_visits)) %>% 
      mutate(totalN = (cumsum(n)),
             percent = round((n / sum(n)), 3),
             cumpercent = round(cumsum(freq = n / sum(n)),3))


```

Date palms at 85% (41/48) of villages received a bat visit. Date palms at case villages received 80% (6454) visits, at far control villages 5.5% (446), and at near control villages 14.5% (1172). Trees at case villages received 80% of bat visits while cases villages have 25% of trees observed. Comparatively, trees at near control villages received 14.5% of bat visits while representing 30% of observed trees. 

```{r}
bat_vil_tot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(case_control_group), fill=yn_visit)) +
    geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-.5) +
    geom_bar(stat = "count") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Villages with and without bat visits by village type")
```


```{r}
# bat visits by tree
bat_tree_tot <- date_palm_vil %>% 
  group_by(Tree_number) %>% 
  summarize(num_visits = sum(Number_of_visits)) %>% 
  mutate(yn_visit = case_when(num_visits > 0 ~ "yes", TRUE ~ "no"))
  #figure out what to do with NAs for tree type

# Add back village type information
# Dataframe with village type information for each tree
tree_vil_info <- date_palm_vil %>% 
                        select(Tree_number,case_control_group)
tree_vil_info <- tree_vil_info[!duplicated(tree_vil_info), ]
tree_vil_info <- na.omit(tree_vil_info)
bat_tree_tot <-
  left_join(bat_tree_tot,
            tree_vil_info %>% dplyr::select(Tree_number, case_control_group))

# trees with no bat visits
bat_tree_tot %>%
      group_by(yn_visit) %>%
      summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(totalN = (cumsum(n)),
             percent = round((n / sum(n)), 3),
             cumpercent = round(cumsum(freq = n / sum(n)),3))

      summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(totalN = (cumsum(n)),
             percent = round((n / sum(n)), 3),
             cumpercent = round(cumsum(freq = n / sum(n)),3))

# average number of visits per tree (for trees with visits)
bat_tree_tot %>% 
  filter(num_visits > 0) %>% 
  select(num_visits) %>% 
  summary()

# average number of visits per tree (for trees with visits), by village type
bat_tree_tot %>% 
  filter(num_visits > 0) %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(min = min(num_visits),
            q1 = quantile(num_visits, 0.25),
            median = median(num_visits),
            mean = mean(num_visits),
            q3 = quantile(num_visits, 0.75),
            max = max(num_visits))
```

Of the 85 trees observed, 71% (61/85) received a bat visit. In case villages, 81% of trees received a bat visit, compared to 62% in far controls and 77% in near control villages. Among trees that received at least one bat visit, the average number of visits was 132. The most visits received by one tree was 5544 at a case village. The average number of visits per tree was highest in case villages (363), followed by near control villages (58) and far control villages (18). 

```{r}
# box plot of bat visits per tree by village type, no outlier
bat_tree_tot %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  filter(num_visits > 0 & num_visits < 5544) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = case_control_group, y = num_visits)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# including trees with no visits and outlier
bat_tree_tot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = case_control_group, y = num_visits)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### Observed bat feeding behavior


```{r data for only visits}
# create a dataset that removes observations with no bat visit
date_palm_visits <- date_palm_vil %>% 
  filter(Number_of_visits != 0)
```

Examine the total number and percentage of visits that resulted in a stay, visits that resulted in a contamination, and stays that resulted in a contamination. 

```{r total visit stays and contaminations}

# visits resulting in a stay
date_palm_visits %>%
   summarize(pct_stays = mean(Number_of_stays), 
             n_stay = sum(Number_of_stays), 
             n_not_stay = sum(Number_of_stays == 0))

# visits resulting in a contamination
date_palm_visits %>%
   summarize(pct_cont = mean(Number_of_contaminations), 
             n_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations), 
             n_not_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations == 0))

# stays resulting in a contamination
date_palm_visits %>%
  filter(Number_of_stays > 0) %>% 
  summarize(pct_cont = mean(Number_of_contaminations), 
            n_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations), 
            n_not_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations == 0))
```

Overall 63% of visits resulted in a stay (5106/8072), 57% of visits resulted in a contamination (4626/8072), and 91% of stays resulted in a contamination (4626/5106).

Examine the number and percentage of visits that resulted in a stay, visits that resulted in a contamination, and stays that resulted in a contamination, with a breakdown by village type. 

```{r visit stays and contaminations by village type}

# trees with no bat visits by village type
date_palm_visits %>%
      group_by(case_control_group) %>%
      summarise(pct_stays = mean(Number_of_stays), 
                n_stay = sum(Number_of_stays), 
                n_not_stay = sum(Number_of_stays == 0), 
                pct_cont = mean(Number_of_contaminations), 
                n_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations), 
                n_not_cont = sum(Number_of_contaminations == 0), 
                pct_stay_cont = mean(ifelse(Number_of_stays == 1, Number_of_contaminations, NA), na.rm = T), 
                n_stay_cont = sum(ifelse(Number_of_stays == 1, Number_of_contaminations, NA), na.rm = T), 
                n_stay_not_cont = sum(ifelse(Number_of_stays == 1, Number_of_contaminations == 0, NA), na.rm = T))
```

Interestingly, the percent of visits that resulted in a stay and the percent of visits that resulted in a contamination was lowest for case villages compared to far control and near control villages. The majority of stays resulted in contamination in all three village types. 

Create bar charts representing the above information with fill color based on stays/contaminations that occurred.

```{r visit stays and contaminations by village type graphs}

# visits resulting in a stay
date_palm_visits %>% 
  mutate(yn_stay = case_when(Number_of_stays == 1 ~ "1", TRUE ~ "0")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(case_control_group), fill = yn_stay)) +
    geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-.5) +
    geom_bar(stat = "count") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Number of bat visits resulting in a stay by village type")

# visits resulting in a contamination
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays == 1) %>% 
  mutate(yn_cont = case_when(Number_of_contaminations == 1 ~ "1", TRUE ~ "0")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=factor(case_control_group), fill = yn_cont)) +
    geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), vjust=-.5) +
    geom_bar(stat = "count") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Number of bat stays resulting in a contamination by village type")

```

Examine stay and contamination durations:

```{r average overall visit durations}

# average stay duration for visits with a stay
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays !=0) %>% 
  select(DurStayT) %>% 
  summary() 

# average contamination duration for visits with a contamination
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_contaminations !=0) %>% 
  select(DurContT) %>% 
  summary() 

# average stay duration for stays that didn't result in a contamination
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays==1 & Number_of_contaminations ==0) %>% 
  select(DurStayT) %>% 
  summary() 

# average stay duration for stays that did result in a contamination
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays==1 & Number_of_contaminations ==1) %>% 
  select(DurStayT) %>% 
  summary()
```

The median stay duration was 6s (IQR: 2-40, max: 21604). The median contamination duration was similar at 5s (IQR: 1-31, max: 21603). Interestingly, the average duration of a stay was higher for stays that did not result in contamination (39s) compared stays that DID result in a contamination (6s).

```{r average duration tables by village type}

# average stay duration for visits with a stay
avg_stay <- date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays !=0) %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(avg_stay_dur = mean(DurStayT), 
            med_stay_dur = median(DurStayT))

# average contamination duration for visits with a contamination
avg_cont <- date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_contaminations !=0) %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(avg_cont_dur = mean(DurContT), 
            med_cont_dur = median(DurContT)) %>% 
  rename(case_control_group3 = case_control_group)

# average stay duration for stays that didn't result in a contamination
avg_stay_ncont <- date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays==1 & Number_of_contaminations !=1) %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(avg_stay_ncont_dur = mean(DurContT), 
            med_stay_ncont = median(DurContT)) %>% 
  rename(case_control_group2 = case_control_group)

# average stay duration for stays that did result in a contamination
avg_stay_cont <- date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays==1 & Number_of_contaminations ==1) %>% 
  group_by(case_control_group) %>% 
  summarize(avg_stay_cont_dur = mean(DurStayT), 
            med_stay_cont = median(DurStayT)) %>% 
  rename(case_control_group1 = case_control_group)

average_duration <- cbind(avg_stay, avg_cont, avg_stay_ncont, avg_stay_cont)
average_duration <- average_duration %>% 
  subset(select = -c(case_control_group2, case_control_group1, case_control_group3))
average_duration
```
Stay and contamination durations were highest in far control villages compared to case and near control villages. 

```{r average duration boxplots by village type}

date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays !=0) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = case_control_group, y = DurStayT)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_jitter()

# average stay duration for visits with a stay
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays !=0) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = case_control_group, y = DurStayT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Median stay duration for visits that resulted in a stay")

# average stay with outliers removed
date_palm_visits %>% 
  filter(Number_of_stays !=0 & DurStayT <10000) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = case_control_group, y = DurStayT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
